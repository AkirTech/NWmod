# NWmod
### Repository of NWmod
A very small mod developed by MCMjun,EFC Tech.    
Though this mod may have been abandened,you can download and edit it yourself~    
### What is the propose of developing this mod ?    
Well, just for helping our construction team finish our building~    
So,I only added some "useful" commands in the mod.     
And,as you can see,I am not a professional Java developer,so I used MCreator to help me.(Though I am learning Java recently.)    
Sadly,I have met so many difficulties during the development of the mod ,due to the bad network condition in China.    
So,I abandened this project      
The other reason is that I have no time to work on the project ,since I got into high school.     
### My dear friend,are you ready to pass on my project?    
It is under MIT License now, and you can use or modify it.    
Thanks!
